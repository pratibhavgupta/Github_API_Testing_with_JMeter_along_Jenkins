# Github_API_Testing_with_JMeter_along_Jenkins
It is an collaborative project and our team did this task on JMeter and generate the Aggregate report for this. And we use the InfluxDB for real time monitoring of our reports in Grafana, So Grafana is one of the great tool to analyse your reports at live bases.
And we also generated the HTML report  for that and we were able to run our project on Jenkins after some configuration and generate the performance report there also.

## Features
- Rest Api testing with Jmeter
- Data driven Testing
- Jenkins
- Grafana with Influxdb
